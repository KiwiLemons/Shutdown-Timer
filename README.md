# Shutdown-Timer

**Important:**
* To change a shutdown time when one is currently active you have to abort the active one and then make a another one.
* Advanced startup does not work on Windows 7 and also as soon you press it it instantly restarts your PC so be ready when you click it.
* Ensure you have you notifications enabled for "Settings" as it is the only way to ensure a timer has been set or aborted. To check go to the Settings app, "System", "Notifications & actions", and then under "Get notifications from these senders" look for settings and ensure it's enabled.(Not sure how to on Win 7)

**Known Bugs:**
* If you mash "Ok" with a time set, your PC instantly shutsdown. (could add a delay after each press but how about you just don't spam the 
"Ok" button?)
 
 (You can also hover over stuff in the .exe to get a brief description of what it is)
